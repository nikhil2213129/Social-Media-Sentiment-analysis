## Introduction
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we use machine learning models to classify social media posts into categories of sentiment, such as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains social media posts or tweets, with labels indicating the sentiment of each post. The dataset includes features such as:
- `PostID`: Unique identifier for each post
- `Text`: The content of the social media post
- `Sentiment`: The sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral)

You can use publicly available datasets such as the [Sentiment140 dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kashishparmar02/social-media-sentiments-analysis-dataset)) or collect your own data using APIs from platforms like Twitter.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `nltk` (for natural language processing)
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
